  <!-- ROADMAP -->
  ## Roadmap
  
  - [] Figure out how to make it so you dont need steam/epic/riot/ea launcher to be running for you to open and play the game but i think that might not be legal so this is the best i could do.
  
  
  See the [open issues](https://github.com/imjord/Favorite-Games-Library/issues) for a full list of future proposed features (and known issues).
